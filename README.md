# RFCs We Love

RFCs we love is a semi-regular meetup for technical discussions
around specifications and standards. It is inspired by the [paperswelove](http://paperswelove.org/) community,
but focuses on technical standards instead of research papers.

So far this is Bangalore only, but if you'd like to start a chapter elsewhere,
[please reach out](https://twitter.com/rfcs_we_love).

A list of previous meetups is at [MEETUPS.md](MEETUPS.md).
